# SSH Login Flask Website
## So Far
- We have created multiple pages for each project. These pages are accessible through the menu on the top of the site
- Each Project page contains links for repl, project plan and journal. Hovering over the project name will give you a drop down with these links.
- Home screen animation done through vanta js.

## Plans
- 
at the top. We have not created the login system yet so all you have to do is run
the program, click the ip link in the terminal, and navigate through the website. For
now, we have just created buttoms and drop down menus for links so if you wish to access
our previous and current projects; simply click the button or menu option. So if you need to access our study journals and project plan and our repl, just click one of the buttons and it will direct you.
