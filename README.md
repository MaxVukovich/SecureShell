##So Far
-We have created a multiple pages that you can visit by selecting the menu option
at the top. We have not created the login system yet so all you have to do is run
the program, click the ip link in the terminal, and navigate through the website. For
now, we have just created buttoms and drop down menus for links so if you wish to access
our previous and current projects; simply click the button or menu option. So if you need to access our study journals and project plan and our repl, just click one of the buttons and it will direct you.
